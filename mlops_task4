I have Develope a project using transfer learning 
Image Classification,using Deeplearning Mobilenet
In in this project i have collect four diffrent type images(in this project i have use four animals images)
some images used for model traning and some images are used for moedel testing 
in this model i have get 90+ accurecy in 2-4 epoch

from keras.applications import MobileNet

# MobileNet was designed to work on 224 x 224 pixel input images sizes
img_rows, img_cols = 224, 224 

# Re-loads the MobileNet model without the top or FC layers
MobileNet = MobileNet(weights = 'imagenet', 
                 include_top = False, 
                 input_shape = (img_rows, img_cols, 3))

# Here we freeze the last 4 layers 
# Layers are set to trainable as True by default
for layer in MobileNet.layers:
    layer.trainable = False
    
# Let's print our layers 
for (i,layer) in enumerate(MobileNet.layers):
    print(str(i) + " "+ layer.__class__.__name__, layer.trainable)
    
    
    def lw(bottom_model, num_classes):
    """creates the top or head of the model that will be 
    placed ontop of the bottom layers"""

    top_model = bottom_model.output
    top_model = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(top_model)
    top_model = Dense(1024,activation='relu')(top_model)
    top_model = Dense(1024,activation='relu')(top_model)
    top_model = Dense(512,activation='relu')(top_model)
    top_model = Dense(num_classes,activation='softmax')(top_model)
    return top_model
